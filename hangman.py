# file: hangman.py is a program that has the user guess a word based on the length they chose (or if not randomly selected) with a limited amount of lives.
# file (cont): The user plays until they completely solve the word or run our of lives, but then are presented with the option of if they want to play again or not. 
# input: user inputs a string
# output: program outputs a string
